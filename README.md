# Pan-Alphafold
### Introduction to PA workflow
#### This pipeline will perform:
##### Homologous genome clustering with Orthofinder 
##### Functional annotation of proteins using DeepFRI
##### Sequence extraction with Seqkit
### Requirements
##### Before using this workflow, you need to install DeepFri (https://github.com/flatironinstitute/DeepFRI)

### 1. Install
##### git clone https://github.com/XuhanDeng/Pan-Alphafold

### 2. Run the pipeline
##### Puts the script, genome file (faa), the Alphafold model dataset, and the uniport id table in the specified location.
##### Run the total.sh file and enter the location of the target file
##### Finally, faafile finalout.fasta is generated
